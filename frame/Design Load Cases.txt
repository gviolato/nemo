#Hope to gather some information here on what are the relevant Design Load Cases for the frame design.

Quote from Human powered ""Overview of a method that can help select and refine the
optimum human-powered vehicle frame design 24-v7n3-1989 page 6:

"I obtained the values for the forces and moments through a variety of ways: general industrial standards, as in "a strong healthy individual can exert a force of up to two-and-a-half times his own body weight on the pedal"; calculations, as in "the force on the chain is equal to the force on the pedal multiplied by the length of the crank and divided by the radius of the chainring"; and estimations, like "the instantaneous maximum pull on the handlebar from a very strong rider would be slightly over 100 lbf"."

We examined the following eight load cases as part of an investigation of the frames' overall safety and performance characteristics:

- Static Start-Up: A 150 pound rider is applying maximum effort to accelerate from a standing stop. The rider is "out of the saddle" and inertial effects are significant. Aerodynamic, rolling, and gyroscopic forces are assumed negligible. The bike is in vertical equilibrium with the front wheel pointed straight. Using published measurements of pedal loads and acceleration, the equations of static and dynamic equilibrium are solved to find chain, pedal, and handlebar loads. We find that loads generated in this case are very similar to those encountered in hill climbing.

- Horizontal Impact: Samples of every manufacturer's frame design must pass certain physical tests to comply with standards set in 1976 by the Bureau of National Affairs (BNA) and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The BNA's "Requirements for Bicycles" manual calls for a single compressive loading test. A load of 980 Newtons (220 pounds) is applied to the front dropouts horizontally, with the rear dropouts constrained from any translational motion. The effect might be similar to a low speed, head-on collision into a wall or curb. To pass the test, there must be no "... visible evidence of fracture or frame deformation that significantly limits the steering angle over which the wheel can be turned".

- Vertical Impact: Vertical impact loads are represented by multiplying the rider's weight by a certain "G factor". For this study, three G's are used to simulate long-term road-vibration effects in the absence of pedaling forces. As a matter of interest, an object dropped from an infinitesimal height onto a rigid surface would exert a two-G impact load, assuming total energy transfer.

- Front-Wheel Braking: It is assumed that the front tire is skidding and thus front pitchover is imminent. Therefore, all weight is concentrated on the front wheel. Inertia loads caused by deceleration are included in the analysis. It is assumed that the rider applies no pedal loads during braking, and that all horizontal forces imparted by the rider are countered at the handlebars.

- Rear-Wheel Braking: Here it is assumed that the rear tire is skidding. Forces and moments imparted to the seatstays by friction reactions at the brake pads are taken into account. All other assumptions are similar to those of the front wheel braking case. There is some conjecture involved in these braking cases, because empirical measured data is lacking on some of the important variables.

- Steady-State Pedaling: This presents the most complex array of applied loads for any case under investigation. A 160 pound cyclist, seated on a 24-pound bicycle, is generating .54 horsepower (400 watts) at a cadence of 80 rpm. The front sprocket has 53T, the rear has 17T. It is assumed that forces due to leg dynamics may be neglected. Aerodynamic forces are also ignored since, at 25 mph, these forces are less than 10 pounds. Pedal forces and moments about the three principal axes are obtained from published test reports. The data allow a partial separation of the rider's mass and damping effect from the system's response. We treat the rider as an "inertia-less" rigid body which still applies its static weight. We then apply the equilibrium conditions at discrete time intervals (i.e. quasi-statically), to find the applied loads at seat, chain, dropouts, and handlebars. This requires the solution of seven simultaneous equations, plus an additional assumption that all horizontal pedal loads (parallel with the ground) are countered at the saddle. This assumption is arguable (because the exact distribution of loads depends on the rider's individual style), but it is not critical. In this study, the quasi-static pedal-load analysis was applied to the "worst case" situation: when the cranks are positioned at the maximum loading angle, approximately parallel with the ground.

- Klein Patent Tests: In Gary Klein's recently-issued patent [later overturned -- John Allen], two tests are defined as indicators of infringement: a lateral bending test and a bottom-bracket torsion test. These tests may have evaluation merit in their own right, but manufacturers also want to avoid legal problems. Thus, it may be important to know whether a proposed design violates patent claims before investing in its full development. Using FEA, these stiffness tests are simulated in advance. The tests call for applying loads to key frame locations, measuring local deflection, and then calculating an equivalent directional stiffness value. More on this later.""
